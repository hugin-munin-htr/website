The drawback of digitized handwritten documents without further processing is that they cannot be analysed by computers. This is presently the case for almost every digitally available handwritten document in the collections of Norwegian libraries, archives, and museums (LAMs). In order to permit large-scale computational search and analysis, the information contained in the documents must be made machine-readable. Adding handwritten text recognition (HTR) capability to large-scale digitization, however, poses many new challenges. Most existing HTR systems have been built for use on small collections of relatively homogeneous manuscripts and are based on extensive training. To achieve acceptable results for new writers, the system must be retrained with information collected from manual transcriptions of new documents.

The HUGIN-MUNIN project aims to go beyond the current state-of-the-art AI supervised deep neural network document processing workflow described above. Instead of a typical current HTR digitization workflow, resulting in a static model incapable of incorporating new information collected about new writers or document types, HUGIN-MUNIN will develop a way to automatically adapt the model to new information by integrating a self-supervised adaptation process to the recognition process. Thus, the project both addresses state-of-the-art AI for handwriting recognition and introduces the integration of an automated, self-learning adaptation process for a dynamic user influenced model, capable of continuously evolving with the addition of information about new writers, content, and document features.

Key to the project will be an interdisciplinary collaboration between specialized research communities within document analysis and HTR, both nationally and internationally. This will expand Norwegian experience and competence in AI/autonomous systems expertise and enhance the innovative potential of the Norwegian LAM sector through transfer of knowledge and best practices.
